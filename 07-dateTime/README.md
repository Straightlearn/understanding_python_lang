#This directory is for date and time manipulations

we use the "datetime" module for opperations on date and time.

#Note
1. we use "datetime.date.today()" only to get the current date.
2. while we use "datetime.datetime.now()" to get the currentdate and time
3. We should is make sure we import the module before using its funtionalities i.e import datetime.
4. Then we can always use "strftime" to format the date and time.
