	When you print out the current date using the datetime.date.today()` in the`datetime` module it willprint date in numbers ie 2022-2-4. looking at this format you can observe a problem.
1. it can be missinterpreted. someone make call it year 2022 in feb in day 4, or another can call it year 2022 in the day 2nd and month april.
2. different countries may have their own type of date format.
	so because 9f all these when need to formate our dates and time.And that is the main aim of this repository.

### NOTE the following
%b is the month abbreviation
%B is the full month name
%y is the two digit year
%Y is for full digit year
%a is the day of the week abbreviation
%A is the day of the week
