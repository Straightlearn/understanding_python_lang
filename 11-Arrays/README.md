# ARRAY

Array is a collwction of a single data type. 
Examples:
```
string_array=["boy","girl","woman","man"]
integer_array=[2,4,76,9]
etc
```
But in python, we dont have a native data structure called array ,unlike other programming languages like C. but we can use the python list, to create arrays in python.If we want more advanced array, then we should use the numpy module.
